	**Welcome to _**  

This repository is the root of my personnal filesystem.  
I haven't uploaded everything from it, only the things I think are useable.  

The licensing for this my work is officialy the WTFPLv2+ but github doesn't  
allow me to do so, so it will be GPLv3+.  
Feel free to use everything from it, for any information you can contact me at  
jaimepaswanadoo@gmail.com
